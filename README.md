# 📸 Memento Flex

**The Student "Flexible" Camera** — Memento Flex is a versatile, AI-powered smart camera built on [Adafruit MEMENTO](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5800).
 Designed for students, creators etc, it "flexes" between a standard digital camera, a scientific observation tool, and an AI-vision assistant.

## ✨ Features

* **🧠 AI-Powered Insights:** Connects to OpenRouter to provide real-time image descriptions.
* **⏳ Smart Time-Lapse:** Includes a "Low Power" mode that dims the screen to save battery during long observations.
* **🎞️ Animation Suite:** Support for both looping GIFs and Onion-skinning Stop Motion.
* **🌐 Automated Sync:** Fetches local time automatically via NTP over Wi-Fi.
* **🛠️ Custom Text UI:** Result text is intelligently wrapped and scaled to be readable on the 240x240 display.
